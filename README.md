Fresh Cabs:

Fresh Cabs is a cab requesting bot.

Nowadays, in organisations or companies, employees prefer taking cabs mostly, but there are even cases like some late night shifts or emergency situation. Therefore, they either send mails or approach the admin to arrange cab for them.
Admins, on the other hand, have to collect the employee details such as to which project does she/he belong, destination they prefer , the availability of the cabs and to check with the vendors for an approval.

Hence, to facilitate the organisation’s admin team, we have come up with an idea of easy ticket raising system for a cab and approval of admin and vendor  with the maintenance of cab and shift records for individual employee.
To elucidate the above idea, our project would allow a user to raise a ticket for cab in case of late night/emergency scenario which is then sent to the admin side, where the admin gets the entire record of the employee and approve the request and reply to the employee by sending the vendor details . On the same time, admin can push the request to the vendor for his/her approval which is updated as status on the dashboard.The Employee can view the entire cab records that he/she has availed so far , the same can be done on admin side.

We have augmented our project with bot as a prime component which will also implement NodeJS(ExpressJS) as backend service , MongoDB for data storage, DialogFlow and on top of all it uses “Freshdesk API” for invoking ticketing services. 

Reason for using slackbot:
    Slack is a professional application for chatting purposes and users in IT sector tend to use Slack very often.
    So, a slack bot prevents the need to switch between apps very often and can be used at ease.
    It also adds up to the professional value.
